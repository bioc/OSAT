The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects - when samples are processed on different days, in different groups, or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating, and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the {ComBat} function, and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva {function.Availability:} The R package sva is freely available from {http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact:} jleek@jhsph.edu},

However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by “batch effects,” the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. {ComBat}, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

	abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes () to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

 of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different

 large differences that may exist among different probes used to
 interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of
 high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by
 photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip
 manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific
 biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable,
 and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis
 methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data,
 and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also
 present model-based methods for identifying and handling
 cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications

Earlier {DWD} implementations, however, relied on Matlab, which is not free and requires a license. The major contribution of the {R/DWD} package is an implementation that is completely in R and thus can be used without any requirements for licensing or software purchase. In addition, {R/DWD} also provides efficient solvers for second-order-cone-programming and quadratic programming.

Using examples from surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight {(SELDI-TOF)} and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation/time-of-flight {(MALDI-TOF)} experiments, we describe several experimental design issues that can corrupt a dataset.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Epigenetic alterations in tissues targeted for cancer play a causal role in carcinogenesis. Changes in {DNA} methylation in nontarget tissues, specifically peripheral blood, can also affect risk of malignant disease. We sought to identify specific profiles of {DNA} methylation in peripheral blood that are associated with bladder cancer risk and therefore serve as an epigenetic marker of disease susceptibility.


{METHODS}

We performed genome-wide {DNA} methylation profiling on participants involved in a population-based incident case-control study of bladder cancer.


{RESULTS}

In a training set of 112 cases and 118 controls, we identified a panel of 9 {CpG} loci whose profile of {DNA} methylation was significantly associated with bladder cancer in a masked, independent testing series of 111 cases and 119 controls {(P} {\textless} .0001). Membership in three of the most methylated classes was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of bladder cancer (95\% {CI}, 2.8 to 9.7), and a model that included the methylation classification, participant age, sex, smoking status, and family history of bladder cancer was a significant predictor of bladder cancer (area under the curve, 0.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.70 to 0.82). {CpG} loci associated with bladder cancer and aging had neighboring sequences enriched for transcription-factor binding sites related to immune modulation and forkhead family members.


{CONCLUSION}

These results indicate that profiles of epigenetic states in blood are associated with risk of bladder cancer and signal the potential utility of epigenetic profiles in peripheral blood as novel markers of susceptibility to this and other malignancies.},
